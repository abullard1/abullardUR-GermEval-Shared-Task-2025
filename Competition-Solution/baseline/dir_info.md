This folder contains the jupyter notebooks and information about the baseline systems that the competition organizers provided.
The competition organizers achieved the following macro-F1 scores on the trial dataset:
- Call2Action: 0.59
- Attacks on the Democratic Basic Order (DBO): 0.47
- Violence Detection: 0.69

The baseline systems are:
- Call2Action: Gradient Boosting
- Attacks on the Democratic Basic Order (DBO): Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a linear kernel
- Violence Detection: Large Language Model (LLM) with a few-shot scenario

The baseline systems are implemented in the jupyter notebooks.
